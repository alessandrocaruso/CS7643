I am an undergraduate student and this was my first experience with Deep Learning and Pytorch.
I did not create anything too fancy, as I tried but it was running very slow (CPU problems) therefore I could not get any good results with complicated infrastructure.
For this reason, and for the fact that I did not know to properly use a pretrained model and transfer learning (even if I have watched all the possible tutorials). I thought it was better to come up with something entirely mine and not copied from someone else.

Therefore I created two convolutional neural network, each of them followed by a relu function and a max pool2d.
I added a drop out after the 2 convolutions and then an affine layer.
After all, I used the softmax function.

The results are more or less the same as the convnet after I trained the parameters.

I got 55% of accuracy in the validation set.
And 52% of accuracy in the test set (So i should beat the chance).
